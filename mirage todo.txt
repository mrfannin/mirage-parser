!! Rewrite comma removal code, super messy !!
!! Look at efficiency of for loops, seems like maybe too many !!
!! Line 41405, and others, doesn't separate lines for some reason !!

- line 197, think of something for Charms

- line 166, dashes occasionally after colors, part of name too, should be easy to remove

- line 2471, annoying names without sizes or colors, happens a couple times, probably ignore, a fix would require a whole rewrite to have everything based on the sku, maybe worth it but idk

- line 28239, maybe add long to size search, not a huge issue right now, check if it breaks others first

- line 34203, same as 28239

- line 39264, doublue black removal, thought I fixed this
