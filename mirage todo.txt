- line 197, think of something for Charms

- line 166, dashes occasionally after colors, part of name too, should be easy to remove

- line 2471, annoying names without sizes or colors, happens a couple times, probably ignore, a fix would require a whole rewrite to have everything based on the sku, maybe worth it but idk

- line 21825, takes the sm in the name as a size, will be ignored because of single value fix, and shouldn't be an issue otherwise

- line 28239, maybe add long to size search, not a huge issue right now, check if it breaks others first

- line 28473, should be fixed with single value fix

- line 30192, more single value fix

- line 30753, more single value fix

- line 33084, annoying names, probably not an issue

- line 34203, same as 28239

- line 37833, single value fix and then annoying names

- line 37981, single value fix

- line 38441, single value fix
